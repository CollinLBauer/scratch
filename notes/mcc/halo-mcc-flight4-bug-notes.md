*Pre-release 1.1367.0.0*

## Menus

Game modes
- There doesn't seem to be a way to save game settings
- Setting primary and secondary starting weapons does not work

Key Bindings
- Double key bindings have been removed since last flight patch?
- Cannot change zoom behavior from toggle to hold
  - seems to be a hybrid between tapping and holding; I like it, but having the option for one or the other would be nice too.

## General gameplay

- Some firing and grenade throw inputs lost when spamming

<br/>

## Audio

Weapons
- Fuel Rod Gun melee is excessively loud
- Rocket Launcher firing sound incredibly muffled under certain circumstances
- Double tapping the Plasma Pistol can lead to charging sound despite not charging

Vehicles
- audio loops (engines, etc.) seem to stutter a lot
- Motor sound effect from Warthog might infinitely loop after exiting vehicle (bug existed in Gearbox port too)

## Behaviors that differ from Gearbox port

These are *really* important to me!

- Getting partially out of bounds may cause player to be stuck; affects lots of old glitches out-of-bounds glitches. Likely related to hitbox detection in NAT code
